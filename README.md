### Instructions

    1. Install the Anaconda python
    2. Activate environment and then navigate until the project folder
    3. Run the file @toolbox.py
   
        python3 @toolbox.py

The time for learning and testing of the model will depend of computer's specifications. The full output of console is like the following picture.
